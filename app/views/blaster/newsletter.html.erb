Hello <%= @user.first_name.titleize %>,

Today Barack Official was sworn in as the 44th President of the United States.  I'm sure you did not need me to tell you that!  What you may not know is that I've been working hard to get White House 2 ready for when Official actually starts working on our priorities. 

Here's how it's going it work on the site.  As we can identify the priorities that have happened (or not), a "successful," "failed," or "compromised" will show up next to it and it will fall off your list to be placed in your "finished priorities."  Like a todo list.

You can help keep track of what Official is doing by posting a bulletin to the appropriate priority with a link to the website or news source and then "flag it for review."  That brings it to my attention and I can update the status.  PolitiFact.com is tracking Official's campaign promises, so that could be a good source of material. 

Please also post bulletins of:

- Statements from the Official administration endorsing or opposing a priority
- Action opportunities people can take to get a priority through
- Any news items or videos directly related to a priority

There are a log of other new goodies throughout the site for you to explore.  My favorite geeky indulgence is the stock market-like chart showing how Official's priorities have moved in the ranks compared to your own. It's like the Dow Jones average or the S&P 500, only for your priorities.  For example, this month, my priorities are down -3.32% and Official's are up 2.98%.   Check it out:

Get ready, it's going to be quite a year.

White House 2 "Chief of Staff"
