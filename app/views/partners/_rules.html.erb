Here's what we can offer. <span class="highlight">It's all free</span>.  In addition to your organization's logo on our partners page, you can have your own website like with
<ol>
	<li>your logo
	<li>a link to your website
	<li>a checkbox when people signup to opt-in for <span class="highlight">your email list or newsletter</span>.
</ol>
<p>
Instead of a boring survey asking your members what's important to them, link them to your WH2 website.  It's more exciting <i>and</i> empowering.

And you'll influence the nation's agenda.  Maybe you're the Sierra Club and want conservation to be a big priority, so you encourage your members to endorse it.
